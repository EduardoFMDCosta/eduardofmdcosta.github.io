This article is inspired by an [interview given by the Brazilian economist Eduardo Moreira][tv-brasil] to the public television network TV Brasil. It aims to provide a simple framework to understand why the economic model currently in place in Brazil cannot deliver on the promises of general social well-being in the next many decades.

First, we notice that half of the Brazilian population (approximately 110 million people) live with an [average monthly income per capita of R$540][income-bottom-50]. This means that the average household (roughly 3 people) receives around R$1.600 per month, or only ~20% above one minimum wage. As a reference: the [average rent][rent] for a $$50m^2$$ apartment in Sao Paulo (Brazil’s largest city) is R$2.650, and in Fortaleza (the cheapest capital for which data was available in the news) is R$1.450. It is absolutely clear that the bottom-50%’s monthly income is not enough to provide a decent basic living standard in urban areas.

Defining a lower bound for a adequate monthly income is a difficult task, however let’s consider for now [Dieese’s estimate of around R$1.650 per capita][dieese]. This implies that each person in the bottom-50% would have to increase their income in approximately R$1.100 in current terms (i.e. from R$540 to R$1.650).

Hence we would need an aggregate additional income of R$1.100/person x 110 million people = R$121 billion per month. In a year, R$121 billion/month x 12 months = R$1.45 trillion. We have an issue though: according to the [World Inequality Database][wid-brazil], the Brazil’s bottom-50%’s share in the national income is historically around 10%, which means that in order to generate R$1.45 trillion for this part of the population, the whole economy would need an income injection of R$1.45 trillion/0.10 = R$14.5 trillion. [Brazil’s GDP][gdp-brazil] in 2023 was R$11 trillion. In order words, we would need to more than double the size of our economy* so that the bottom-50% would meet the *lower-bound* of the basic income. 

In the last 10 years, [Brazil’s GDP has grown][gdp-growth-brazil] approximately 1.1% per year. At this rate, obtaining the desired GDP would take almost 80 years. As people usually have children between 20-30 years of age, we are talking about 2-3 generations living below decent standards for half of our population. This is simply unacceptable. 

One should not miss the fact that our rough estimates are very sensitive to one particular piece of data: the small share (10%) of the national income which goes to the 50% poorest households. Suppose that this share was actually 20% (as [in France][wid-france]). Then, the needed additional of annual income would be R$7.2 trillion (much lower than the previous R$14.5 trillion), which could be reached in 45 years (vs 77 before) under the same assumptions.

This analysis reinforces the idea that economic growth alone will not be enough to alter the social reality of Brazil, and redistribution mechanisms (e.g. tax system, social programs, etc) seem to be of equal importance. 

* *I am not a specialist in the definition of the GDP (far from it actually), but I wonder whether we should adjust to the fact that the [labor share of the GDP][labor-share] is historically close to 65%, or if this is somewhat already encoded in the figures above. If indeed this adjustment is fair, then the correct value for the additional needed income would be R$14.5 trillion/0.65 = R$22 trillion.*
