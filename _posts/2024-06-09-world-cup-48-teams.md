From 2026 on, the Men’s Football World Cup will be played by 48 national teams, instead of the usual 32. The teams will be [divided into 12 groups of 4][fifa-format], playing a single round-robin tournament, from which the top two and eight best third-placed will be qualified for the playoffs.

It is not unreasonable to assume that FIFA’s main motivations behind the inclusion of 16 new countries are money (higher TV & advertisement, and game-day revenues) and power (more political support from the confederations benefitted by the expansion), and those arguments [find echo on a relevant part of the sports media][general-critics].

Although I understand and agree with this view, I must confess that I think that the consequences of the expansion will be fantastic. First, [Africa is receiving 4 new spots][bbc-allocation], while Asia is getting 3. Given the low representation of those continents in past editions of the competition, and also considering their recent strong performances, those places are definitely well-deserved. Additionally, Europe is taking 3 new places, which decreases the chances that football powerhouses such as Italy or the Netherlands will stay out of the tournament as happened before. Finally, South America and its highly competitive qualifiers receive one extra spot. This means that we are guaranteed to have several additional nations for which football is a central cultural aspect playing in the World Cup.

Many journalists have [pointed out that the extra teams could decrease the technical level of the competition or even diminish the competitiveness of the regional qualifiers][sportive-critics]. This is completely true. However, do we really care about the technical level in a World Cup? Do we care about the qualifiers in general? I would safely assume that both answers are negative for most football supporters. For the first question, I would argue that the appeal of a World Cup is primarily driven by emotion rather than skill, especially at a time when European club football already provides weekly exhibitions of refined technique. As for the second question, it's worth noting that the qualifiers already face a general lack of interest (at least in Brazil), except for a few notable matches (e.g. against Argentina).

Enough of my personal opinion. Let’s take one step back, and discuss the format of a World Cup with 48 teams. Before settling for the 12 groups with 4 teams scenario, FIFA had initially proposed 16 groups with 3 teams, with the top two classifying for playoffs. At that time, [this article written by the French mathematician Julien Guyon][risk-collusion] gained prominence. In this paper, Guyon discusses the risk of collusion (i.e. the teams playing the last game of the group potentially match fixing so both advance) in groups of 3 teams and shows that the probability of collusion in at least one group is very high. The author also suggests alternative formats that could reduce the risk of collusion, and, interestingly, FIFA has adopted one of them. I am not aware of the impact of this particular paper (or the related literature) on the organization’s final decision, but it is always interesting to see how scientific reasoning can sometimes help us to make robustly improved decisions.
