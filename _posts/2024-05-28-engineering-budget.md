Some weeks ago, I attended the [opening of one of TU Delft's robotics labs][opening-cor] and was impressed by its infrastructure. This experience prompted me to consider whether such an investment would be feasible for a Brazilian engineering school. Not having the time for a proper analysis, I choose to present some relevant data that I quickly gathered comparing the budgets of one of Brazil's leading engineering schools with those of some of its international peers.

According to the University of São Paulo's [budget plan][budget-poli], the Polytechnic School (its engineering unit) is expected to have approximately R$ 375 million (or EUR 67 million) to spend in 2024. With around [8,500 FTE (Full-Time Employees)][students-poli] (including undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, and administrative staff), the annual budget per FTE comes to about EUR 7,900.

In contrast, TU Delft (Netherlands) had funding of around EUR 880 million for 30,000 FTE in 2022, resulting in a ratio of EUR 29,000 per FTE, more than three times higher than the Brazilian school. At École Polytechnique (France), [a public report][budget-polytechnique] indicates that the annual formation cost per student was about EUR 36,000 in 2016-17 (though this figure is not directly comparable to the other schools, it provides a rough estimate). Lastly, Polytechnique Montreal (Canada) [operates with a budget of EUR 150 million][budget-poly-montreal] for 10,000 FTE (2018-19), leading to EUR 15,000 per FTE, or twice the ratio of the Brazilian school.

I point the interested reader to these schools' annual reports to understand the specific details (sources, destinations, distribution of FTE, profile of the research programs, etc) of each budget. Needless to say, any errors in the data presented above are my responsibility, and these figures represent my best interpretation of the annual reports.

Despite the limited depth of this analysis, the significant difference in budget per capita (2-3x) when comparing one of Brazil's leading engineering schools with other top-tier international schools suggests that Brazilian engineering may lack the resources needed to compete globally.
