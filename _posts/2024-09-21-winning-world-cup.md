The last time Brazil lifted the World Cup trophy was over two decades ago. Since then, we have endured a series of painful eliminations, often at the hands of European teams - including the unforgettable 7-1 loss to Germany on home soil in 2014.

This article serves as a reminder of an important truth: winning a World Cup is incredibly difficult and it usually takes time.

**How long is a reasonable wait for another title?** Given that at least 5-6 teams usually have similar chances of winning each tournament (Brazil, Germany, Italy, Argentina, and France are perennial favorites, with teams like the Netherlands and Spain occasionally fielding strong squads), Brazil would statistically win the World Cup roughly once every 5-6 editions, or every 20-24 years. For instance, Brazil took 24 years to win its fourth World Cup after 1970, just as Germany did after 1990 and Italy after 1982. Similarly, France waited 20 years after 1998, and Argentina endured a 36-year gap following their 1986 victory. Long waits are not an exception; they are the norm. And this makes sense from a statistical standpoint under our initial assumption.

**The path to victory: a simple probabilistic perspective**: Suppose Brazil always reaches the knockout stage, as it historically has. To win the World Cup, a team must win four consecutive playoff games (increasing to five under the new 48-team format). If Brazil enters each playoff match with a 60% chance of winning, the overall probability of becoming champions is just 13% ($$0.6^4$$). The breakdown of *elimination* chances at each stage is as follows: Round of 16 (40%), quarterfinals (24%), semifinals (14%), and final (9%). Under these conditions, Brazil is expected to be eliminated before the semifinals about 65% of the time. Even with a 70% match winning probability, the odds of winning the tournament rise only to around 25%, and the team is still expected to exit before the semifinals half the time.


Before moving on, an important remark: does this mean that Brazil's fate is solely dictated by these probabilities and that nothing can be done to increase our chances? Absolutely not. Organization, tactical choices, and mental preparation may significantly improve match-winning probabilities, especially in early games like the Round of 16 and quarterfinals. In each of Brazil's recent eliminations, one can identify (tactical) decisions that were clearly detrimental to the team's performance during the game, potentially reducing the chances of progressing.


In a recent interview after Brazil's loss to Paraguay in the South American qualifiers, the Brazilian coach Dorival Junior boldly claimed that he guarantees he will be in [the World Cup final][espn] in 2026. Given the odds outlined above, one might suggest that purchasing a ticket to the final could be his safest bet.
